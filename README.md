<h1>S-DES Brute Force</h1>
This is a brute-force algorithm for simplified DES encryption (S-DES), which finds the original 10-bit key used to encrypt plaintext-ciphertext pairs.

Since S-DES only uses a 10-bit key, this program will try all possible key combinations (1024) until it finds the one that matches the plaintext-ciphertext pairs entered by the user.


<sub>Note: Entering only one pair has a chance of outputting an incorrect key, so entering at least two pairs is advisable. </sub>
