<h1>S-DES Brute Force</h1>
his is a simple brute-force algorithm I made for the simplified DES encryption (S-DES). Since S-DES only uses a 10-bit key, this program will try all possible key combinations until it finds the one that matches the plaintext-ciphertext pairs entered by the user.


<sub>Note: Entering only one pair has a chance of outputting an incorrect key, so entering at least two pairs is advisable. </sub>
